            The title character, Saitama, is a bald-headed 25-year-old man who
            is bored of fighting because he is able to effortlessly defeat enemies
            with a single punch.Vol. 1 He lives in an apartment in City Z.
            His abilities mainly consist of physical abilities magnified to an
            immeasurable degree: strength is the true power of Saitama, with speed,
            stamina, and durability being mere side-effects. He attributes this to
            a daily training regimen (100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats, a 10 km
            run, eating healthy food, and abstaining from use of the air conditioner
            or heater in order to reinforce his mental fortitude.) (He also mentions
            training even when his body was wounded and made strange cracking sounds).
            Three years of this spartan training pushed Saitama to his limits, making
            him evidently unbeatable.

            The Japanese manga series One-Punch Man contains a number of fictional characters created by One and
            illustrated by Yusuke Murata. The series follows a superhero named Saitama and his disciple Genos who join
            the Hero Association so they can be recognized as such when they fight various monsters and villains. The
            Hero Association ranks all of its members by a Class and a ranking within that class. Characters listed are
            ones noted by the author in the manga profiles, ones that were highlighted in the anime character list, and
            ones that recur over several story arcs.
